# esphome-lvgl-screenshot

An ESPHome custom component that serves a live BMP screenshot of the LVGL framebuffer over HTTP.

Designed specifically for **ESP32-P4** with an RGB parallel display running LVGL via ESPHome.
Unlike other screenshot components, this one reads directly from the LVGL draw buffer rather than
the display driver's framebuffer, making it compatible with custom display backends.

## Requirements

- ESP32-P4 (or any ESP-IDF based ESPHome target)
- LVGL configured in ESPHome (`lvgl:` component)
- `buffer_size: 100%` recommended (ensures a complete frame is always in the buffer)
- PSRAM (the BMP buffer is allocated in PSRAM — ~1.1 MB for an 800×480 display)

## Installation

Copy the `components/lvgl_screenshot/` folder into your ESPHome project's `components/` directory,
then reference it in your YAML:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: local
      path: components
    components: [lvgl_screenshot]

lvgl_screenshot:
  port: 8080  # optional, default 8080
```

## Usage

Once flashed, open a browser and navigate to:

```
http://<device-ip>:8080/screenshot
```

The response is a 24-bit BMP image of whatever is currently on screen.

### Home Assistant Generic Camera

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
camera:
  - platform: generic
    name: "My Display"
    still_image_url: http://<device-ip>:8080/screenshot
    content_type: image/bmp
    scan_interval: 10
```

## How it works

1. An HTTP GET to `/screenshot` signals the ESPHome main loop via a FreeRTOS binary semaphore.
2. The main loop captures the LVGL draw buffer (`lv_disp_get_default()->driver->draw_buf->buf_act`)
   and converts it from RGB565 to a 24-bit top-down BMP in PSRAM.
3. The HTTP handler waits (up to 3 s) for the capture to complete, then streams the BMP in 4 KB chunks.

All LVGL buffer access happens on the ESPHome main task, keeping it thread-safe.

## Notes

- ESPHome builds LVGL with `LV_COLOR_16_SWAP=1`, so the green channel is reconstructed from
  the `green_h` and `green_l` bitfields.
- Only one screenshot request is served at a time; concurrent requests receive a 503 response.
- The HTTP server runs on its own port (default 8080) and does not depend on ESPHome's `web_server` component.
